Electrum noob. HELP.
I am having a frustrating time trying to send fumds from my wallet. I used a password that I keep offline and secure, I'm very sure it is the corrtect one. I think the first version here on my box is 1.9.8, i've had 2.0.4 and now 2.1.1. I have gone to my roaming folder and deleted the Electrum file. re-install and when it asks me for my 'seed' I enter it but it doesn't take. It will accept my public master key tho. But it is still a wallet that has the password locked. I've read on a couple of forums that it's easy to get a wallet back with your seed. I have one, but it is 24 words long. I read that nowdays it is 12 or 13? Have I been locked up away, away? So I have 24 while most have 12. i'm sure thgat this may be the problem. I know i'm using the correct PW, and I have tried most things that have been posted. Now to you, the Great Oz. Is there a work around? I want to use Electrum but if I can only recieve funds and not send them, i'm no where. HELP, plea
